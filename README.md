face detector :        there are three ros nodes 
                       1. camera node
                       2. face detector node
                       3. coordinate receiver node


id number detector:    there are two nodes 
                       1. id number publisher node
                       2. id number subscriber node





### And i also attached the cascade classifiers for the faces and eyes

 And there are opencv python codes for
                * the face detection and
                * id card number detection
                * face detection Pan and Tilt servo control
                  
 which where used before creating the ros nodes (in Pycharm IDE)
